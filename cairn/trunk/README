CAIRN - Copy And Intelligently Restore via Network
--------------------------------------------------

CAIRN is a modular computer image copy and restore program.  It can copy 
every file on a computer and gather information on how to recreate it from
bare metal. CAIRN is primarily a network oriented restore program, but is
also flexible enough to boot from any possible method.

About
-----

CAIRN is a highly flexable program that allows for onsite tweaking of its code.
Custom modules of code can be created on the fly. These can be used to perform
custom setup that your machine or image needs. The CAIRN framework allows for 
easily inserting your custom code into the right spot in the order of
operations.

But having such flexability does not compromise the ease of use of CAIRN. The
majority of situations can be handled automatically by CAIRN. The most common
need for intervention is making sure the correct drive is when restoring an
image to a different machine than where it came from.


Status
------
CAIRN is in BETA stage right now. Do not be surprised if this release makes
your computer sprout legs and run off into the forest never to be seen again.
It is possible. Seriously though this is the first release of CAIRN and is 
very beta. We are confident it will work with simple setups, but there is NO
guarantee. This is mainly a testing release for anyone who is inclined to test
it. If you have a spare machine and would like to test CAIRN please let us
know. Any help will be greatly appreciated. The nature of a project like CAIRN 
is such that there simply can never be enough testing on enough different
setups.

Vist http://trac.cairn-project.org to file bugs or enhancement requests. Since
CAIRN is pretty new there is a lot left to be done. If you have a great idea
get it in quick.

Currently CAIRN supports imaging a computer and restoring it exactly as it was
originally. The next release of CAIRN will focus on being able to adjust how
the image is restored and to account for changes in hardware.



Quick Help
----------
This is about as simple as it gets, and it will get more simple with the next
releases.

Copying:
1) On the machine that is to be backed up copy the 'cairn' program file over.
2) Run it like:
      cairn copy <filename>
3) Copy <filename> off to a different machine.

Restoring:
1) Boot the target machine into a Linux environment that has Python. One of the
   recent versions of Knoppix works very well.
2) Copy the 'cairn' program file over.
3) Copy the image file created in the copying stage onto this machine. Or use
   a network filesystem so CAIRN has access to it.
3) Run it like:
      cairn restore <filename>


Documentation
-------------

Currently there is not a large amount of documentation. Running CAIRN with no
arguments will invoke the help. This is the best documentation right now.


To Do
-----
A lot of things need to be done and I will touch on the big tasks here. Please
go to http://trac.cairn-project/roadmap for a more complete list.


- A boot environment for the restore program. It will be flexable enough that
  it will be able to boot off nearly any medium or method out there.
- Software RAID and LVM support.
- More platforms. Solaris, Darwin/OSX, and MS Windows are the major platforms
  being considered. MS Windows is being worked on and Darwin/OSX has had a
  little work done on it.
- Documentation. Basically it just needs to be done.
- A utility to manage unattended network booting of machines and running CAIRN
  for restoring and/or cloning.
- Lots and lots more.
