CAIRN - Copy And Intelligently Restore via Network
--------------------------------------------------

CAIRN is a modular computer image copy and restore program.  It can copy 
every file on a computer and gather information on how to recreate it from
bare metal. CAIRN is meant to be primarily a network oriented restore program,
but is flexible enough to boot from any possible method.

About
-----
CAIRN is a modular copy and restore program for the imaging of a
computer.  It can copy every file on a computer and gather information
on how to recreate it from bare metal. CAIRN is meant to be primarily a
network oriented restore program, but is also flexible enough to boot
from any possible method.

CAIRN can also be used to clone one machine to many. It has the
intelligence to adjust the image to fit the machine being restored. It 
can adjust partition sizes, device types of drives and all the internal
configuration of the operating system to match up with the changes.

CAIRN is built on a highly modular system to accomodate the varying
requirements of different operating systems. Every single step of the
process is a separate module. The order of steps can be varied or
rearranged as needed to fit the environment of the machine being restored. 

CAIRN's highly flexable nature also allows for onsite tweaking of 
its code. Custom modules of code can be created on the fly. These can
be used to perform custom setup that your machine or image needs. The
CAIRN framework allows for easily inserting your custom code into the
right spot in the order of operations. A 'module of code' can either be
a full python module file or a few lines of shell scripting. The benefit
of this flexability is that you can run those two commands that are
required for your particular hardware in the exact right spot within
the copy or restore procedure.

But having such flexability does not compromise the ease of use of CAIRN.
CAIRN is organized around a multi-level interface. Each level increasing
the complexity exposed to the user. The user is free to use parts of any
of the interfaces in any mixture. The simplest level relies on CAIRN
choosing the correct course of action. While the most complex level of
the interface is only useful for debugging the program itself.

The core operating systems that are planned to be supported are Linux,
Mac OS/X, Microsoft Windows, and Solaris. Other operating systems can be
added as time and desire permits. Currently only Linux is supported, but
the other operating systems are under development.

Besides having a copy and restore program, CAIRN also has a utility
program that the user can control multiple CAIRN restores from. 
DHCP and PXE are used to network boot a machine into a small boot
environment and from there CAIRN will restore the machine. This is also
how a user will easily customize the behavior of the CAIRN restore program.


Status
------
CAIRN is in BETA stage right now. Do not be surprised if this release makes
your computer sprout legs and run off into the forest never to be seen again.
It is possible. Seriously though this is the first release of CAIRN and is 
very beta. We are confident it will work with simple setups, but there is NO
guarantee. Please do not rely on this release to backup anything important.

This is mainly a testing release for anyone who is inclined to test it. If
you have a spare machine and would like to test CAIRN please let us know. Any
help will be greatly appreciated. The nature of a project like CAIRN is such
that there simply can never be enough testing on enough different setups.

Vist http://trac.cairn-project.org to file bugs or enhancement requests. Since
CAIRN is pretty new there is a lot left to be done. If you have a great idea
we would love to hear about it.

Currently CAIRN supports imaging a computer and restoring it exactly as it was
on the original hardware it was copied from. The next release of CAIRN will
focus on being able to adjust how the image is restored and to account for
changes in hardware or for cloning one machine to others.



Quick Help
----------
This is about as simple as it gets, and it will get more simple with the next
releases.

Copying:
1) On the machine that is to be backed up copy the 'cairn' program file over.
2) Run it like:
      cairn copy
3) This creates a filename like hostname-data.cimg. Copy this file off to a
   different machine.

Restoring:
1) Boot the target machine into a Linux environment that has Python. One of the
   recent versions of Knoppix works very well.
2) Copy the 'cairn' program file over to the boot environment.
3) Get access to the image file. CAIRN currently requires normal file level
   access to the image file. The easiest way to accomplish this is export a NFS
   share with the image file in it. Later versions will make this easier and not
   require something like NFS.
3) Run it like:
      cairn restore <filename>


Documentation
-------------

Currently there is not a large amount of documentation. Running CAIRN with no
arguments will invoke the help. This is the best documentation right now.

There are some documents in the doc directory, but are mainly related to
developers needs.


To Do
-----
A lot of things need to be done and I will touch on the big tasks here. Please
go to http://trac.cairn-project/roadmap for a more complete list.


- A boot environment for the restore program. It will be flexable enough that
  it will be able to boot off nearly any medium or method out there.
- Software RAID and LVM support.
- More platforms. Solaris, Darwin/OSX, and MS Windows are the major platforms
  being considered. MS Windows is being worked on and Darwin/OSX has had a
  little work done on it.
- Documentation. Basically it just needs to be done.
- A utility to manage unattended network booting of machines and running CAIRN
  for restoring and/or cloning.
- Lots and lots more.
