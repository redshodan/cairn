CAIRN is mainly written in Python but some parts are C. The main CAIRN
binary must be compiled then both the C and the Python parts must be packaged
into one binary.

Getting the source
------------------
To obtain the source download a release sourceball or download via subversion.
See the http://code.google.com/p/cairn project page for downloads. To check
via subversion use the following command:

   svn co http://code.google.com/svn/cairn/trunk cairn

If you wish to contribute to CAIRN you must use svk instead of subversion. The
homepage for svk is http://svk.bestbits.com. svk is required for submitting
changes to subversion. Please see the documentation in the developers
directory for more information.

Requirements
------------
To compile CAIRN correctly you must have header files or devel packages
installed for Python. The rest of CAIRN depends on the operating system. Please
see the correct section for details.

All operating systems:

   Python: 2.3 or greater is required. Tested on 2.3 and 2.4, should work on
           2.5 correctly.

Linux:
   Devel packages for the following:

       glibc: version 2.3 or greater
              Any modern version of glibc should work fine. glibc 2.3 or
              greater is known to work. If you wish to compile on a newer
              version of glibc and then run the program on a machine with
              an older version you will have problems. Because of versioning
              in glibc this will cause problems. It is generally safe to
              compile on the older version of glibc and run on newer versions.

       libuuid: Around version 1.38 or greater
              libuuid is from e2fsprogs project.

Compiling
---------

1) Run make from the top level. This will compile all the third party packages
   and the CAIRN binary itself. The resulting binary will be named
   build/bin/cairn. This program contains all the funcionality of CAIRN.

   If something fails to compile please let use know.
