CAIRN is largely dependent on external tools for gathering particulars about
the machine that is run on and restoring it. These tools vary depending on
the operating system.

For all systems Python version 2.3 or greater is required.

       
Linux
-----

Some of the very basic system tools that any Linux system must have to be
functional are required. They are:

    for copy and restore: tar, gzip
    for restore: mount, umount, chroot, sync

During the restore the bootloader must be restored. The installer for the boot
loader must be available in the image itself. Currently grub is the supported
boot loader

Also the mkfs programs are required. If your archive does not contain a
filesystem of the particular type then the corresponding mkfs is not required.
This includes mkswap. The full list is:

    mkfs.ext2, mkfs.ext3, mkfs.xfs, mkfs.jfs, mkfs.resiserfs, mkfs.msdos,
    mkfs.vfat, mkswap

LVM2 is supported and is optional. If no LVM2 tools are found or the archive
does not have any LVM volumes then it is not required. Currently only LVM2
is supported. LVM1 support is in the roadmap. The list is as follows:

    for copy and restore: pvscan, vgscan, lvscan, vgcfgbackup
    for restore: pvcreate, vgcfgrestore, vgchange

Software RAID via mdadm is supported and also is also optional. There is only
one program for mdadm and that is:

    for copy and restore: mdadm
