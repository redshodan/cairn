#summary xar archiver

xar, [http://code.google.com/p/xar/ http://code.google.com/p/xar/], is a very extendable archiver. It does almost everything that is desirable from the view of a project like CAIRN.

Here are a few items that would be nice to have in addition to xar. They would probably require adjustments to xar or at least extra meta data for each file.

  * Option to sha1sum each file. meant for having a 'verified' image with which to compare a machine against to check for modifications.
  * diff/overlay of files for having different 'views' of output files.
  * parrallel drive reading. some dynamic adjustment to prevent overloading perhaps or just flat out? see which does better overall.
