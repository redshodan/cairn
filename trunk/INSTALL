CAIRN - Copy And Intelligently Restore via Network
--------------------------------------------------

CAIRN is a modular computer image copy and restore program.  It can copy 
every file on a computer and gather information on how to recreate it from
bare metal. CAIRN is primarily a network oriented restore program, but is
also flexible enough to boot from any possible method.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Linux on the x86 platform currently has the best support. CAIRN is largely
developed on x86 linux. Linux PPC support is partially done and should be more
complete in the next release.

Mac OS/X is very slightly supported. Meaning that a small amount of development
went into OS/X at the start of the project but has lagged behind greatly and is
essentially unusable currently. Contributions to the OS/X effort would be greatly
appreciated.

Microsoft Windows has some prototype work being done and is in progress.

Solaris support is planned in future revisions.

Other operating systems currently have not been explicitly planned for but as
always contributions are welcome. If you have that itch to add support for a
particular platform please contact us and discuss it.
